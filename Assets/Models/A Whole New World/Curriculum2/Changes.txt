Observation:
// Agent can't manage to learn parrying, suspect is due to a lack of information
 - Added one more observation from centerMoveTo to oppEpee2/3. 
 - Added collided collider type information in BufferSensor. 

Training Configs:
// policy is almost not converging, decrease beta.
 - Decreased beta from 0.005 to 0.001. 
// Time_horizon: This number should be large enough to capture all the important behavior within a sequence of an agent's actions.
// as increased physics timestep from 0.001 to 0.002, plus the key moment is actually the last second's action, 1 sec about 500 so 512. 
 - Reduced time_horizon back to 512.

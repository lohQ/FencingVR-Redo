Right hand's IK Rig is for adjusting hand position/rotation if collided. Base motion controlled by animation. 

Every physics frame, check distance/angle between hand's position and it's supposed position to hold epee. 
Place the hand effector at the midpoint. 
The further the hand effector from hand, the heavier the IK rig weight. (exponential increase)

If blade is collided from front, don't allow doing stepping forward/lunging (might cause the blade to snap to hand). 


Normalize observation.


Physics test scene?
- systemize it?
